# Todo App

This installable web app (SPA/PWA) enables you to manage your todo lists containing tasks.

The app was built using React, Redux, React Router, MUI, Firebase & deployed with GitHub Pages.

If you're using Google Chrome, navigate to https://vadimgierko.github.io/todo-app/. New “install” icon will appear on the url right-hand side. The install icon looks like an ‘install icon’ symbol inside a computer screen icon, usually to the left of the share this page icon. Install may be accessed by tapping or clicking the install icon.

This app was initially generated from my [vadimgierko/react-redux-router-firebase-auth-rtdb-crud-mui-app template](https://github.com/vadimgierko/react-redux-router-firebase-auth-rtdb-crud-mui-app#readme) & expanded afterwards.
